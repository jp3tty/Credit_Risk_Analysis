# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. The following exercise uses machine learning (ML) techniques to assess credit risk of an inherently unbalanced class distribuition of good loans against risky loans.


## Results
The datas "loan status" was used from the "LoanStats_2019Q1" dataset to train a six ML model for determining if a credit applicantion is considered high or low risk. Predictions were run for each and they were compared for accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Naive Random Oversampling


### SMOTE Oversampling


### Undersampling


### Combination Sampling


### Balanced Random Forest Classifier


### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier



* There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models



## Summary
The models used to perform the risk analysis show weak precision in determining high credit risk. 

* There is a summary of the results
* There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification
