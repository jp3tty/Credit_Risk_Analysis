# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. The following exercise uses machine learning techniques to assess credit risk of an inherently unbalanced class distribuition of good loans against risky loans.


## Results
A dataset, labeled "loanStats_2019Q1", contained 

* There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models



## Summary
The models used to perform the risk analysis show weak precision in determining high credit risk. 

* There is a summary of the results
* There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification
