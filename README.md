# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. The following exercise uses machine learning (ML) techniques to assess credit risk of an inherently unbalanced class distribuition of good loans against risky loans.


## Results
"Loan status" entries were used from the "LoanStats_2019Q1" dataset to train a number of ML models for determining whether a credit applicantion should be considered high or low risk. Predictions were preformed for each and they were compared for accuracy, precision, and recall.
